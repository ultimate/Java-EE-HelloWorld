Java-EE-HelloWorld
==================

## Introduction
I was asked by some collegues to give them an **introduction to the Java Enterprise archictecture and the tools and libraries I am using for my project [syncnapsis](https://github.com/ultimate/syncnapsis/) for creating a Java based web server**. So  we sat together and created a sample project from scratch i would like to share here for the public.

This tutorial will deal with the following tools/libraries:

* Tools
  * <a href="#java-jdk-7">JDK/JRE 7</a> (Installation)
  * <a href="#maven-2">Maven 2</a> (Installation and configuration)
  * <a href="#jetty-8">Jetty 8</a> (Installation and configuration)
  * <a href="#eclipse">Eclipse</a>
* Libraries
  * ...

**Note:** I know there are newer versions available as well for most of the tools as for the libraries but I preferred to use the same version as used for [syncnapsis](https://github.com/ultimate/syncnapsis/) for now to assure compatibility and to simplify the access to that project. I hope I will have the time to update this tutorial one day or at least when syncnapsis was updated, too. 

## Pre-Requisites

Before we can start with the example itself we have to prepare our development environment. If you already have a system prepare for the following tools, you may skip this section, but I recommed you fly over it anyway, to be sure your setup matches mine.

### Java JDK 7

Since we want to create a web server in Java of course we will need to install the JDK (Java Development Kit) which contains the tools for compiling our project and not just the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which is required for executing the program.

So download and install the JDK (which will include the JRE, too) from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

### Maven 2

... http://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/binaries/

### Jetty 8

... http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/stable-8/dist/

### Eclipse

### Configuring the environment
